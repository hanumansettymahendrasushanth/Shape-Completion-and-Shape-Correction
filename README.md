## **Introduction**
Curvetopia is a Python-based project that processes 2D curves, adjusting their symmetry and ensuring they are smooth and free of irregularities. The project can be particularly useful in fields such as computer graphics, geometric modeling, and data visualization, where curve smoothness and symmetry are crucial.

## **Features**
- **Symmetry Adjustment**: Automatically detects and adjusts curves to be symmetric.
- **Curve Regularization**: Smooths out curves using advanced smoothing techniques like cubic B-splines and Savitzky-Golay filters.
- **High Flexibility**: Easily configurable parameters to control the level of smoothing and symmetry adjustment.
- **Visualization**: Clear and detailed plotting of the processed curves for easy visualization.

## **Installation**
To get started with Curvetopia, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/curvetopia.git
   cd curvetopia

2.**USAGE**
   1.After installation, you can use the provided Python scripts to process your curves. Here's a basic example of how to run the script:

   Prepare Your Data:

   2.Ensure your data is in a CSV file, with the required format. 
   Run the Symmetry and Regularization Script:
   `
    ```bash 
   python main.py --input your-data.csv --output output-file.csv 
    `

   3.View the Results:
   The processed curves will be saved and can be plotted using the provided plotting script.
